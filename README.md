# HumanPaste
A MacOS shortcut that slowly pastes text with a human typing pace

## Requirement
To make the shortcut work properly, you must open Shortcuts > Settings > Advanced and enable "Allow running scripts". This is because a script is necessary to press the keys for you in order to make it look as if you were typing it yourself
